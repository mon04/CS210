*30 November 2021*

### Problem Statement
<!---Problem Statement here--->
Write a recursive method that takes in a bank account balance *x*, an interest rate *i*, and a number of years *y*, and outputs how much the bank account will be worth afer *y* years. For example, if you invest €100.00 at 2% annual interest, then after 1 year you have €102.00, after year 2 you have €104.04, after year 3 you have €106.12, and so forth.

### Input format
<!---Input format here--->
The main methid, which is already written, takes in a bank account balance as a double, *x*, interest percentage rate as a double, *i*, and the number of years for which it is being invested, *y*.

### Output format
<!---Output format here--->
A double representing how much the bank account is worth after *y* years, correct to two decimal places.

### Constraints
0 ≤ *y* ≤ 30
0.0 ≤ *i* ≤ 100.0
0 ≤ *x* ≤ 1000000

### Sample Input
```

1.3
100
```

### Sample Output
```
