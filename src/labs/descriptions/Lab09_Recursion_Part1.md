## Lab 9 - Recursion - 1. Recursive mathematical function
*30 November 2021*

### Problem Statement
<!---Problem Statement here--->
Write a recursive method that, given input n, computes the output of the following function:
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; f(n) = 2,&nbsp; &nbsp;if n = 1</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; f(n) = 4*f(n-1) - 3n&nbsp, &nbsp;if n&nbsp;&gt; 1</p>

### Input format
<!---Input format here--->
The main method, which is already written, takes in an integer, which is the number of people in the class.

### Output format
<!---Output format here--->
Output a long, which is the output of the function on n.

### Constraints
0 ≤ *n* ≤ 40

### Sample Input
```
68
