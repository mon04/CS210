## Lab 4 - Monte Carlo Simulation
*19 October 21*

### Problem Statement
<!---Problem Statement here--->
Given *N* students in a class, how likely is it that some of them share the same birthday? Use a Monte Carlo simulation to determine to the nearest percent the probability that at least *x* number of students in a class of size *n* have the same birthday.

### Input format
<!---Input format here--->
Two integers, the first is *N*, and the second is *X*

### Output format
<!---Output format here--->
An integer between 0 and 100, which is the % probability that *X* students in a class of *N* share the same birthday

### Constraints
-1000 ≤ *N* ≤ 1000

### Sample Input
```
20 2
```

### Sample Output
```
41
