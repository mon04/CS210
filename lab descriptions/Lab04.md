## Lab 4 - Monte Carlo Birthday Problem
*19/10/2021*

### Problem Statement
<p>Given <em>n </em>students in a class, how likely is it that some of them share the same birthday? Use a Monte Carlo simulation to determine to the nearest percent the probability that at least <em>x </em>number of students in a class of size <em>n </em>have the same birthday.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><strong>Input Format</strong></p>

<p>Two integers, the first is <em>n </em>and the second is <em>x</em></p>

<p> </p>

<p><strong>Output Format</strong></p>

<p>An integer between 0 and 100, which is the % probability that <em>x </em>students in a class of <em>n </em>share the same birthday</p>

<p> </p>

<p><strong>Constraints</strong></p>

<p>0≤<em>n</em>≤1000</p>

<p>1≤<em>x</em>≤10</p>

<p> </p>

<p><strong>Sample Input</strong></p>

<p>20 2</p>

<p> </p>

<p><strong>Sample Output</strong></p>

<p>41    (the probability that two students in a class of size 20 share the same birthday is 41%)</p>
