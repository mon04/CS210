### Problem Statement
Given *n* students in a class, how likely is it that some of them share the same birthday? Use a Monte Carlo simulation to determine to the nearest percent the probability that at least *x* number of students in a class of size *n* have the same birthday.

### Input format
Two integers, the first is *n* and the second is *x*

### Output format
An integer between 0 and 100, which is the % probability that *x* students in a class of *n* share the same birthday

### Constraints
0 ≤ *n* ≤ 1000

1 ≤ *x* ≤ 10

### Sample Input
```20 2```

### Sample Output
```41```
