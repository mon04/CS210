## Lab 3 - Primes
*12/10/2021*

### Problem Statement
The goal is to read in a number *N* and output the *distance* between the prime number that preceeds it, and the prime that follows it. If the number itself happens to be prime, then output the distance to the subsequent prime. For example, if *N* is 7, then output 4, because the next prime is 11, with is 4 away.

### Input format
An integer *N*.

### Output format
The distance between the preceeding and subsequent prime number at *N*.

### Constraints
2 ≤ *N* ≤ 1000

### Sample Input
```10```

### Sample Output
```4```
